# Kick Off Times 

This is for the main website to promote and support the Kick Off Times open-source project.

Simplest explanation is as follows:

 * _MLP_ - **Template** - simple website to display sports events from a data source (JSON data, possibly from API)
 * _Stage 2_ - **Website** - promotional content site to explain this in greater detail and how to get involved
 * _Stage 3_ - **API** - provides structured data for sports events
 * _Stage 4_ - **App** - tool to manage sports event data in the API

Main objective is to **create a community to build the codebase(s) and instructions to create real world examples**.
