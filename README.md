# Kick Off Times 

This is for the main website to promote and support the Kick Off Times open-source project.

Simplest explanation is as follows:

 * **API** - provides structured data for sports events
 * **Template** - simple website to display sports events
 * **App** - tool to manage sports event data
 * **Website** - to explain this in greater detail and how to get involved

## Help out! üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

We're looking for Web engineers to help build Kickoff Times out, work out a sensible approach to get something to market quick and lay the foundations for something that can scale.
